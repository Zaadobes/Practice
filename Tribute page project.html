        <h2><b>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</b></h2>
             <ul id="tribute-info">
                 <li><p><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa </p></li>
    <li><p><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, <br>thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</p></li>
    <li><p><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps,<br> helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me." </p></li>
    
<li><p><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</p></li>
<li><p><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. <br>Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman,<br> who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</p></li>
<li><p><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected.<br> Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,<br> disinfectants, and other applied science.</p></li>

<li><p><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</p></li>
<li><p><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, <br>and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years,<br>his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including <br>different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</p></li>
<li><p><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</p></li>

<li><p><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,<br> creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</p></li>
<li><p><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent<br> in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population </p></li>
<li><p><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</p></li>

<li><p><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields </p></li>
<li><p><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</p></li>
<li><p><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." <br>Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand,<br> as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous <br>because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. <br>Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</p></li>
<li><p><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</p></li>
 
 </ul>
